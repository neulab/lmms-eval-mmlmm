Multilingual MMMU: Multilingual Massive Multi-task Multimodality Understanding

## Instruction
Multilingual MMMU is a benchmark that aims to evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models in understanding multilingual multimodal data across multiple tasks. It provides a standardized evaluation framework and dataset for researchers to compare and analyze the general understandability of different multimodal models in handling various knowledge tasks in multilingual cases. 

We are looking for high school or college exam questions that have both image and text in the question:
- The question needs to contain both image and text.
- The question needs to be highly precise, and the answer needs to be easy to verify, e.g., a multiple-choice answer, a number, a list of number, or a boolean variable, etc.
- The topic covers Art, Business, Medical,  Humanities, Science and Engineering. See the full list of the category in the following.
- You can either find questions from the Internet, or Textbook or come up with your own question (if you are an expert in that field).
